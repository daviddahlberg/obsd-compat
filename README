OpenBSD compatibility scripts for Debian
========================================

This installs symlinks and wrappers for usual OpenBSD commands into a
Debian system to prevent muscle memory errors.

The following files and directories will be installed:

 * /usr/local/sbin/rcctl (wrapper around /usr/sbin/service)
 * /usr/local/bin/doas (symlink to /usr/bin/sudo)
 * /etc/rc.d (symlink to /etc/init.d)

Installation
============

make install

CAVEATS
=======

Make sure that the directories are correctly specified in the Makefile.
Otherwise the /install/ and /uninstall/ targets may destroy 
configuration and system files.
